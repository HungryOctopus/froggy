## OPEN QUESTIONS

- mobile first? => yes
- what should be displayed in the home view? General info if not authenticated and general info + personal statistics if authenticated? Same sign-up for volunteer and organizer?
- how to block people that register as an organizer but are not organizers? => create it in the API directly
- do we need the organizer profile? What should an organizer do that the volunteer can't?
- should volunteers be able to see the profile of others? => no
