# FROGGY

Our application is divided between a client-side ReactJS application and a server-side Node.js application.

## Server-side

### Models

- User

  - name
  - email
  - passwordHashAndSalt
  - role: volunteer or admin

- frog counter
- Notification
- Admin
- Calender (?)
- Message dashboard: this will be the message model that the Admin POSTs messages to. We will then GET these messages and display them in volunteer user profile

- picture gallery
- gamification / trophy

## OPEN QUESTIONS

- what should be displayed in the home view? General info if not authenticated and general info + personal statistics if authenticated? Same sign-up for volunteer and organizer?
- how to block people that register as an organizer but are not organizers? => create it in the API directly
- do we need the organizer profile? What should an organizer do that the volunteer can't? => no organizer profile
- should volunteers be able to see the profile of others? => no

## DESIGN

- mobile first
